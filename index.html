    The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] 
    It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic 
    cat or house cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.[4] Cats are commonly kept as house pets 
    but can also be farm cats or feral cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids human contact.[5] Domestic cats 
    are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill vermin. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by 
    various cat registries.[6]
